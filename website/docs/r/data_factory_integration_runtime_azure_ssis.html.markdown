# azurerm_data_factory_integration_runtime_azure_ssis

Manages a Data Factory Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory" "example" {
  name                = "example"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory_integration_runtime_azure_ssis" "example" {
  name                = "example"
  data_factory_name   = azurerm_data_factory.example.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  node_size = "Standard_D8_v3"
}
```
